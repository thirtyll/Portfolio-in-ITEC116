# Portfolio-in-ITEC116

The portfolio for ITEC116 includes five laboratory exercises that we completed in the course.

**Laboratory 1:** This lab focuses on calculating the factorial of a number using the endpoint `/factorial/{starting_number}`.

**Laboratory 2:** In this lab, I create a To-Do List API that supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using HTTP methods. The endpoints are `GET /tasks/{task_id}`, `POST /tasks`, `PATCH /tasks/{task_id}`, and `DELETE /tasks/{task_id}`.

**Laboratory 3:** This lab teaches how to work with JSON data in Python, including reading JSON strings, exploring the data, and converting Python data into valid JSON.

**Laboratory 4:** In this lab, which connects with Laboratory 2, I add error handling to the To-Do List API. If a task doesnâ€™t exist, the system will return a 404 error when trying to access, delete, or update it.

**Laboratory 5:** This lab is about deploying the API from Laboratory 4 to Render.com, making it live and accessible on the web.
